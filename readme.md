In this project I have performed Data Analysis on the Data of mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The mice have been given
various drugs to experiment and study the results.

Various Python libraries are used in this project i.e. pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy.stats

The data is provided in two .csv files which I merged to form a combined Data Frame.

Firstly, I removed the duplicate mice to clean data.

I perofrmed calculations to find measures of central tendencies of tumour volumes.

Then I created a summary of the results and displayed on screen.

For presentation of multiple analysis, I have used pandas and matplotlib.pyplot to generate bar charts, line graphs, box plot and pie charts to effectively present the analysis which can be user friendly and easy to understand.

Correlation and Regression have also been calculated between tumour volume and weight of mice for a specific drug regimen known as 'Capomulin'. And then displayed using the line plot.
